# EDA of Percieved Attractiveness From Different Lightings/Exposures

### Description of the Data:
The data comes from two separate experiments in which a number of participants were photographed in identical conditions barring changes in only lightings and exposures respectively. The photos of these participants were then rated on a subjective scale from 1-10 by volunteers.

### Conclusions:
1. Lighting has a significant effect on percieved attractiveness
    1. Overhead lighting is the worst, while a single 45 degree box light was the best.
1. Exposure does not have a significant effect on percieved attractiveness
    1. Even if you cherry-pick the averages of the highest and lowest exposures, there is still no significant difference.
